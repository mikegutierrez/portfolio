		description: 'The Creative Suite gives anyone the ability to design retargeting advertising campaigns in minutes. I was invloved in three code basses that make up this product: A2, Creative Libary and Ad Builder. A2 is the front end XML markup language that SteelHouse ad units are built on. I was responsible for building out tags and coming up with new ways to improve the language. The Creative Library houses a collection of templates users can select from to get their campaigns started. I helped build out the UI and integrate A2 for rendering template previews. The Ad Builder is a drag and drop editor for customizing A2 templates. Users can upload their own content from YouTube, Instagram or just about anywhere else for use in their campaigns without writing a line of code. My role in this project ranged from A2 code base changes to product strategy.',
