		description: 'The Creative Suite is software that gives anyone the ability to design retargeting advertising campaigns in minutes. I was invloved in three code basses that make up this product - A2, Creative Libary and Ad Builder. A2 is the front-end XML markup language that SteelHouse ad units are built on. I was responsible for building out tags and coming up with new ways to improve the language. The Creative Library is like the app store for SteelHouse ad units. It holds a collection of templates users can select from. I helped build out the UI and integrate A2 for rendering template previews. The Ad Builder is a WYSIWYG editor for customizing A2 templates. Users can upload their own content from YouTube, Instagram or just about anywhere else they keep it, and use it in their campaigns without writing a line of code. My role in this project ranged from A2 code base changes to product strategy.',
